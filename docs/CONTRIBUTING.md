#### dev environment
reflekt uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for packaging and dependency management. If you use poetry, this repo includes `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files to help spin up a dev environment. Simply navigate to the root of this repo on your machine and run.

```bash
poetry install
```

If you prefer to use another solution (e.g. pipenv, venv, conda) for packaging and dependency management, a `requirements-dev.txt` is included in this repo as well.
